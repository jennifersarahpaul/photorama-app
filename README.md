Swift iOS app

### Requirements
* Xcode Version 7.2.1

### Description
This is a single-view app to practice iOS programming with Swift. The goal of this app is to learn web services/api integration. The concept of the app is to read in a list of recent photos from Flickr. The app has not been deployed - use Xcode's iPhone simulator (iPhone 6s) to check it out.
